## Authors

Compile using `make`. The binary is found under `bin`.

To run the ColorFitter for to `run/test_HERMES/` and call the fitter as `../../ifit.exe`.

Look at the functions defined in `source/main.cc`, there `runColorFitter()` and `runColorFitterVariant()` are the most useful. The former one helps to set a complete fit configuring everything, and the latter runs defined fits.

Legacy analysis code based on the HERMES data results available here: [https://github.com/jolopezl/ColorFitter-AnalysisTools].
